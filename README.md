# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-AI

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for the detection and classification of brain tumors using medical imaging data. The goal is to create a robust and accurate system that can assist healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify brain MRI images into different tumor types, including glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. By automating the tumor detection and classification process, this system can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis, leading to better patient outcomes.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of brain MRI images, which includes images from four different tumor types: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set, allowing for the development and evaluation of the deep learning model.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, which includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The MRI images are resized, normalized, and preprocessed to ensure consistent input for the deep learning model.
2. **Model Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and trained to classify the brain MRI images into the four tumor types.
3. **Training and Validation**: The model is trained on the training dataset and its performance is evaluated using the validation dataset.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**: The final model is tested on the unseen test dataset, and its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are reported.

## Results
The trained deep learning model achieves a high accuracy in classifying the brain MRI images into the four tumor types. The detailed performance metrics and visualizations of the model's predictions are presented in the project report.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of AI-powered solutions in the field of medical imaging and diagnosis. The developed brain tumor classification system can be integrated into clinical workflows to assist healthcare professionals in making more accurate and timely decisions, ultimately leading to improved patient care.

## Future Work
Possible future enhancements to this project include:
- Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures for improved classification performance.
- Incorporating additional clinical data (e.g., patient demographics, symptoms) to enhance the model's decision-making.
- Deploying the model as a web application or mobile app for wider accessibility and real-world deployment.
- Conducting further validation and testing on larger and more diverse datasets.
